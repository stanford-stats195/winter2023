This short course runs for weeks one through four of the quarter. It is recommended for students who want to use R in statistics, science or engineering courses, and for students who want to learn the basics of data science with R. The goal of the short course is to familiarize students with some of the most important R tools for data analysis. Lectures will focus on learning by example and assignments will be application-driven. No prior programming experience is assumed.

  This is the main way that you and the teaching team should communicate:
  we will post all important announcements here, and you should ask
  all course-related questions here.
  For personal matters that you don't wish to put in a private Ed post, you can
  email the teaching staff at [stats207-aut2223-staff@lists.stanford.edu](mailto:stats207-aut2223-staff@lists.stanford.edu).
- [Canvas](): The course Canvas page
  contains links and resources only accessible to students.
- [Gradescope](): We use Gradescope for managing coursework (turning in, returning grades).  Please use your
  @stanford.edu email address to sign up for a Gradescope account.

**Prerequisites**: A well-prepared student will have knowledge of:
  * Math:
    * Linear algebra (matrix/vector operations, orthogonality, etc.)
    * Multivariate calculus (gradients, partial derivatives)
  * Probability:
    * Random variables, expectations, Gaussian distribution, conditional and marginal distributions
  * Statistics / machine learning basics:
    * Linear regression and classification and, ideally, overfitting and bias-variance tradeoff
    * Parameter estimation, including via maximum likelihood estimation
    * Confidence intervals
  * Programming proficiency in:
    * Python (preferred for this course) or R
    * or Julia, etc. with an ability to (i) pivot to Python with starter code or (ii) code independently in selected language

From experience, eager students with a strong quantitative background are able to catch up and fully participate.  

**Course Grade**: The course grade will be based on the following components.

- 5 Homework Assignments (45%): HW0 (5%), HW1 - HW4 (40%)
- Concept Quizzes (15%)
- Final Project (40%)
