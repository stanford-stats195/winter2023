To get started with R, you should download R as well as RStudio, a software application that makes R easier to use. 

## Installing R

Go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) website and download the latest version for your OS and follow the instructions. 

## Installing RStudio 

Go to the official [website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) and download and install the latest version for your OS. 

Note that even if you use RStudio, you’ll still need to download R to your computer. RStudio helps you use the version of R that lives on your computer, but it doesn’t come with a version of R on its own.
