## Course Objectives

The goal of this class is to help you learn the most important tools in R that will allow you to do data science. A typical data science project looks like this:

There are three main steps in a data science project: you **prepare** the data, **analyze** it using visualization and models, then **communicate** the results. 

First, you must **import** your data into R. Once you've imported your data, you need to **tidy** and **transform** the data into a useful form for analysis. Organizing data into the right, consistent structure is essential as it lets you focus on answering questions about the data. 

Next steps are **visualization** and **modelling**. Visualization and modelling are complementary. Good visualizations help you raise new questions about the data. However, visualizations don't scale particularly well as they rely on human interpretation. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale much better. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise with visualization, you can use a model to answer them.

The last step is **communication**. An anlysis is only meaningful when you communicate your results to others and convince someone to take action. 

**Throughout the course, you will be able to learn these tools and develop your own data science projects!**
