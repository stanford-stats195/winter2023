## Course Objectives

The goal of this class is to help you learn the most important tools in R that will allow you to do data science. A typical data science project looks like this:

First, you must **import** your data into R. Once you've imported your data, you need to **tidy** and **transform** the data into a useful form for analysis. Organizing data into the right, consistent structure is essential as it lets you focus on answering questions about the data. 

Next steps are **visualization** and **modelling**. Visualization and modelling are complementary. Good visualizations surprise and help you raise new questions about the data. However, visualizations don't scale particularly well as they rely on human interpretation. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale much better. However, a model cannot fundamentally surprise you as they have their own assumptions. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise with visualization, you can use a model to answer them.

The last step is **communication**. An anlysis is only meaningful when you communicate your results to others and convince someone to take action. 

**Throughout the course, you will be able to learn these tools and develop your own data science projects!**
